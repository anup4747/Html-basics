/* RGB Format: The RGB(Red, Green, Blue) format is used to define the color of an HTML element by specifying the R, G, B values range between 0 to 255. For example: RGB value of Red color is (255, 0, 0), Green color is (0, 255, 0), Blue color is (0, 0, 255) etc. */

/* RGBA Format: The RGBA format is similar to the RGB, but the difference is RGBA contains A (Alpha) which specify the transparency of elements. The value of alpha lies between 0.0 to 1.0 where 0.0. represents fully transparent and 1.0 represents not transparent. */

/* HSL: HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness respectively. This format uses the cylindrical coordinate system.

Hue: Hue is the degree of the color wheel. Its value lies between 0 to 360 where 0 represents red, 120 represents green and 240 represents blue color.
Saturation: It takes percentage value, where 100% represents completely saturated, while 0% represents completely unsaturated (gray).
Lightness: It takes percentage value, where 100% represents white, while 0% represents black */
